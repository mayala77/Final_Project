### Project Spcifications
association rules, price is a limiting fact, weighted association rules mining. 
kmean: clustering analysis 
independence, and be able to explain the information
walk through code and explain it in detail

Choosing specific housing parameters out of the data and determining what 
is the most abundant, affordable, and types of housing?
